**主题：** Stolen Domain Report - niijima-koutsu.com (Hijacked for Illegal Gambling)

---

Dear GoDaddy Abuse Team,

I am writing to report that my domain **niijima-koutsu.com** has been stolen and is now being used to host an illegal online gambling website.

## Domain Information

- **Domain:** niijima-koutsu.com
- **Registry Domain ID:** 2651988385_DOMAIN_COM-VRSN
- **Original Registration Date:** November 2, 2021
- **Registrar:** GoDaddy.com, LLC
- **Current Name Servers:** ainsley.ns.cloudflare.com / huxley.ns.cloudflare.com

## What Happened

I am the legitimate owner of niijima-koutsu.com. This domain was registered for my company **Niijima Koutsu Co., Ltd. (千路商事株式会社)**, a licensed transportation company operating in Osaka, Japan. The domain was used as our official corporate website.

I recently discovered that:

1. **The domain has been hijacked.** I can no longer access the domain management panel or any associated accounts.
2. **The website now displays an illegal online gambling site** called "AFA88BET," advertising slot machines, sports betting, and other gambling services. This content has no connection to my company.
3. **The domain WHOIS record was updated on December 14 and December 19, 2025**, which I believe is when the unauthorized changes were made.
4. **The domain appears to be listed for resale** through GoDaddy's brokerage service at ¥17,999, suggesting the hijacker is attempting to profit from the theft.

## Evidence of Ownership

- **Company Name:** The domain "niijima-koutsu" directly corresponds to our company name (新島交通 / Niijima Koutsu).
- **Current Official Website:** We have since moved to **niijima-koutsu.jp**, which is our verified official domain for the same company.
- **Business Registration:** I can provide our Japanese company registration certificate (登記簿謄本) confirming our company name and my role as a director.

## Current Status of the Domain

- The domain is currently serving illegal gambling content (screenshots available upon request).
- The domain has been put up for resale through what appears to be GoDaddy's aftermarket.
- The domain's privacy protection shows "Domains By Proxy, LLC," which may have been added by the hijacker.

## Request

I respectfully request that GoDaddy:

1. **Immediately freeze/lock the domain** to prevent further transfer or sale.
2. **Investigate the unauthorized changes** made to this domain in December 2025.
3. **Restore the domain to my account** or assist me in the recovery process.
4. **Remove the illegal gambling content** or suspend DNS resolution until ownership is resolved.

I am prepared to provide any documentation required to verify my identity and ownership, including:
- Japanese company registration certificate
- Government-issued identification
- Previous domain management records
- Screenshots of the illegal content currently hosted on the domain

This matter is urgent as the domain is actively being used for illegal gambling operations and may also be listed for sale to a third party.

Please advise on the next steps to recover my domain.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

**Yuan Hao (员昊)**
Director, Niijima Koutsu Co., Ltd. (千路商事株式会社)
